    "# Modularity Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity is a quantitative metric used to evaluate the strength of a network's division into modules (or communities). It measures how well the network is partitioned by comparing the density of edges within communities to the expected density of such edges in a randomized network that preserves the original degree distribution. The formula for modularity is given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q = \\frac{1}{2m} \\sum_{i,j} \\left[ A_{ij} - \\frac{k_i k_j}{2m} \\right] \\delta(c_i, c_j)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "* $m$: Total number of edges in the graph (sum of all edge weights for a weighted graph).\n",
    "* $A_{ij}$: Element of the adjacency matrix, representing the weight of the edge between node $i$ and node $j$ (0 if no edge).\n",
    "* $k_i$: Degree of node $i$ (sum of weights of edges connected to node $i$).\n",
    "* $k_j$: Degree of node $j$.\n",
    "* $\\delta(c_i, c_j)$: Kronecker delta function, which is 1 if node $i$ and node $j$ belong to the same community ($c_i = c_j$), and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "While [testing the significance of communities](test_significance_of_community.ipynb), we already saw that a high modularity score does not necessarily mean a better community partitioning, as was evident in the Grid Graph mentioned earlier.\n"
